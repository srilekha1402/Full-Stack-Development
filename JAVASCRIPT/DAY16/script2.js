//  Form validations: Validations are like checkers for values that user enters in each field in your form.
 
//    1. Create a signup form that  contains
//   username(!empty),
//   email(@, !empty), 
//  password(should be 6) and 
//  confirm password(same as password value, !empty), 
//  once you click on submit button, a alert should be popped up on you screen "form is submitted successfully" if and only if all the validations are correct.
